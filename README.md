**(Focus: Core OOPS Fundamentals – Classes and Objects)**

* Learned the fundamental concepts of **Classes and Objects** in Java.
* Understood how a **class** defines the blueprint (data and behavior) and how **objects** act as real-world instances of that class.
* Practiced designing classes with variables and methods, and creating multiple objects from them.
* Gained better understanding of how objects communicate through method calls.
* Emphasized writing **clean, readable, and well-structured OOPS-based code**.
* Followed standard **naming conventions, proper indentation, and consistent formatting**.
* Systematically organized all **Class & Object** programs under the `java-oops-practice` branch.
